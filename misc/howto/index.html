            I'd like to share with you the big picture of my approach to
            designing and developing websites. My hope is that after reading
            this you will understand what you are getting yourself into, you
            will be able to articulate your requirements, and you will feel
            confident when talking to potential vendors.

        <h2>Five Tasks</h2>
        
        <p>Building a website involves five tasks:</p>
        
        <dl>
        
            <dt>Server Administration</dt>
        
                <dd>Keeping the website online and available</dd>
        
        
            <dt>Software Development</dt>
        
                <dd>Building features like e-commerce or content management</dd>
        
        
            <dt>Graphic Design</dt>
        
                <dd>Visually communicating your messages</dd>
        
        
            <dt>Training and Support</dt>
        
                <dd>Helping you and your audience use the website's features</dd>
        
        
            <dt>Internet Marketing</dt>
        
                <dd>Promoting your site through search engines, etc.</dd>
        
        </dl>
        
        <p>As you can see, this represents a wide spectrum of skill sets.
        However, not every website is equal. For example, a corporate intranet
        may not need very much graphic design work or online advertising, but
        it will probably need a good deal of feature development and training.
        Understanding the specific requirements of your website can help you
        ask the right questions when shopping for vendors.</p>
        
        <h2>Ok, Six</h2>
        
        <p>Actually, there is a sixth task: <strong>project
            management</strong>. You see, website projects can be quite risky,
        for a number of reasons, e.g.:</p>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li>Requirements change</li>
        
            <li>Technologies change</li>
        
            <li>Computer systems don't always talk to each other</li>
        
            <li>Project team members don't always talk to each other</li>
        
            <li>Budget and time expectations can be unrealistic</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>The agreement between client and vendor is basically an alliance
        formed to conquer a project's inherent risk. The problem is that
        knowledge is what minimizes risk&mdash;knowledge of the project's true
        requirements; knowledge of what other team members know or think they
        know&mdash;and knowledge costs money.  Management, therefore, means
        doing two things:</p>
        
        <ol>
        
            <li>Efficiently acquiring necessary knowledge</li>
        
            <li>Making decisions based on the knowledge at hand</li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>So it is not enough to simply write software or do graphic design.
        The actual construction tasks must be orchestrated in a way that
        minimizes project risk.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Before you contact vendors, write down what you can about your
        project's requirements as well as your project's risks. (If yours is a
        large project, you probably already have a formal project specification
        process.) Then when you talk to vendors, you should ask them what their
        experience is both executing and managing projects like yours.</p>
