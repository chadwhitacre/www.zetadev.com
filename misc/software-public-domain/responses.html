            <b>Subject:</b> request for clarification regarding dedications to the public domain<br />
        </p>

        <p>Dear Mr. Rosen and Mr. Lessig:</p>

        <p>I am trying to form an opinion on software copyright and licensing
        issues, and I am confused by an apparent difference of opinion between
        yourselves on whether it is possible to dedicate software to the public
        domain. This confusion is shared by others.[1]</p>

        <p>Mr. Rosen, I've found a statement on your website saying that "there
        is no mechanism in the law by which an owner of software can simply
        elect to place it in the public domain."[2]</p>

        <p>In contrast, Creative Commons does include dedications to the public
        domain as part of it's program,[3] and we've found this instance of Mr.
        Lessig explicitly referring to such dedications:</p>

          <blockquote>It is therefore perfectly permissible for the owner of a
          copyright to do nothing with it. And it would be perfectly permissible
          for the owner of a copyright to give it away &mdash; to dedicate it to
          the public domain. (And if you'd like to do that, Creative Commons
          will help). But again, GPL'd software is not dedicated to the public
          domain. [4]</blockquote>

        <p>Would either of you care to comment on this apparent difference of
        opinion?</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>


        <p>yours,<br />

        <p>Chad,</p>

        <p>Copyright law says that copyright "subsists" in original works, and it doesn't
        take any action on the part of an author to claim or assert copyright. In this
        regime, a work becomes a part of the "public domain" only when its copyright
        expires by the passage of time or, in a few other limited cases, such as when it
        is written by a U.S. government employee in the course and scope of his or her
        work.</p>

        <p>What, then, is an author to do who expressly wishes to renounce his or her
        copyrights? There is no statutorily authorized procedure for this, but many
        attorneys (and Creative Commons) suggest ways.</p>

        <p>A "dedication to the public" is one alternative, as is a "waiver of rights to
        assert," both of which let everyone know that there is no risk of their being
        accused of infringement for doing what the author expressly appears to be
        authorizing, namely practicing any of the author's exclusive rights to make
        copies or derivative works. Most of us treat such statements of copyright
        disclaimer as the legal equivalent of a broad license with no terms and
        conditions and, from the donor's perspective, it works the same way.</p>

        <p>For creative content other than software, such a dedication carries few
        risks. The recipient of the work understands that he will not be challenged if
        he makes copies or derivative works, and the donor recognizes that he is not
        likely to be sued by anyone as a result of making such a generous donation.</p>

        <p>Software, however, carries other risks. Because software can cause
        unfortunate and perhaps unforeseen harm, the donor may risk a lawsuit even by
        giving his property away. For software, then, it is better not to "dedicate the
        work to the public domain" and instead to license it with an express statement
        of warranty disclaimer. That is the theory behind the simple BSD license,
        although it does a few other things relating to trademarks and attribution.</p>

        <p>So I don't disagree with Lessig's recommendation for non-software, but I
        strongly encourage a more thorough license for software that could do things
        that, in theory at least, cause harm.</p>

        <p>There are many other advantages of a detailed license containing clear terms
        and conditions rather than a simple dedication to the public or a waiver of
        rights. I don't bother restating those other advantages here, but they relate
        primarily to the rules of contract formation, interpretation and enforcement.
        Such terms are particularly relevant for software.</p>

        <p>I also want to agree with another point often made by Lessig, namely that the
        changes to copyright law in the U.S. that made copyright "subsist" and that
        removed the formalities of registration and marking of works, had dramatic
        unintended consequences. Not only was the public domain made MUCH smaller, but
        it became harder for people to let their works be freely used by everyone
        without using a license. Such a burden!</p>

        <p>I agree with Lawrence. Our licenses are expressly not to be used for
        software. This is one of the reasons. And while I'm optimistic that
        sufficiently affirmative steps would succeed in moving a work into the
        public domain, it has not been tested. I therefore believe it is safest
        for people to use a simple Attribution license.</p>
