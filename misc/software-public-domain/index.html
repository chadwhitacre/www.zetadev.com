        <h1>Software and the Public Domain</h1>

        <p>by <a href="/">Chad Whitacre</a></p>

        <p class="description">Can software be put in the public domain?
        Probably.<br />Should it? Probably not.</p>

        <p>Lately I've been trying to form an opinion on software copyright and
        licensing, and one of the options I'm looking at is dedicating software
        to the public domain. While other licensing options (GPL, BSD, etc.) are
        fairly well staked out, I found some confusion in the community about
        the public domain. Folks debate whether it is a good idea to dedicate
        software to the public domain, of course&mdash;copyright and licensing
        are perennial hot buttons. But some seem to question whether such
        dedications are even possible at all.</p>

        <div class="sidebar-right"><p>To illustrate their luminosity: Mr. Lessig
        is chair of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative
        Commons</a>, while Mr. Rosen has served as general counsel for the <a
        href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p><p> See their
        respective websites for further credentials.</p></div>

        <p>This confusion stems in particular from various comments by <a
        href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> and <a
        href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/rosen.htm">Lawrence Rosen</a>, two of
        cyberspace's brightest legal luminaries. Mr. Rosen <a
        href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/lj16.htm">raises doubts about the
        advisability and possibility of dedicating software to the public
        domain</a>. On the other hand, the Creative Commons <a
        href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">allows for
        dedications to the public domain</a> (although their primary thrust is "some
        rights reserved" licenses), and Mr. Lessig

        <a href="http://linux.sys-con.com/read/38116.htm?CFID=176814">has

        hinted that software in particular can indeed be dedicated to the
        public domain</a> [note: find "public domain"].</p>

        <p>After doing some homework, I contacted them both and asked if they
        would clarify their understanding of software and the public domain for
        us. Both kindly responded, and this document is my understanding of the
        issue based on <a href="responses.html">their responses</a>, coupled
        with some other resources. In particular, I would also like to
        acknowledge the <a href="http://sqlite.org/support.html">sqlite-users
        mailing list</a>, and especially Ulrick Petersen, for <a

        href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.sqlite.general/12313">their

        contributions to the discussion</a>. In the end, though, the opinions in
        this article are mine, and I am not a lawyer.</p>

        <h3>What is the Public Domain?</h3>

        <p>Dedicating something to the public domain means voluntarily giving up
        your rights to it. This isn't actually a license, because a license
        derives from ownership, from copyright. Licensing your intellectual
        property is like renting out a car that you own, or loaning your car to
        a friend. The car is still yours. Dedicating a work to the public domain
        is more like abandoning your perfectly good car on the side of the road,
        for any and all to use.</p>

        <p>While this might seem a little crazy when talking about cars (unless
        you believe in <a
        href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067185/">Maude</a>), it actually
        makes some sense when talking about ideas. That's because intellectual
        property escapes some of the limitations of physical property. In
        particular, an idea can be in two places at once, or as <a
        href="http://www.centerpd.org/quotes.htm">Thomas Jefferson put
        it</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction
        himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine,
        receives light without darkening me.</blockquote>

        <p>For more background on the public domain, I recommend the
        Creative Commons' <a
            href="http://creativecommons.org/about/legal/">"Legal Concepts"
            page</a>.</p>


        <h3>Can Software Be Put in the Public Domain?</h3>

        <p>Short answer: probably. When an author publishes a work, s/he is
        automatically granted copyright in that intellectual property. Copyright
        is the default setting. When the copyright expires (generally 70 years
        after the author's death), the work reverts to the public domain. But in
        order for a work to become part of the public domain before then, it
        must be explicitly placed there.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the mechanism for explicitly dedicating a work to
        the public domain is not clearly spelled out in the law. The most
        cautious interpretation of the situation, therefore, is that explicit
        dedications to the public domain are not in fact possible. A more
        moderate reading would say that the waters simply have yet to be
        charted. After all, copyright has only been the default since 1989.
        Before then works were assumed to be in the public domain unless
        explicitly copyrighted.</p>

        <p>Another issue with dedications to the public domain is that some
        countries, Germany for instance, do not recognize forfeitures of
        copyright at all. The author of a work has an inherent copyright that
        cannot be disavowed. So at least for software projects with German
        contributors, then, the answer would appear to be closer to, "No."</p>


        <h3>Should Software Be Put in the Public Domain?</h3>

        <p>Short answer: probably not. The primary consideration seems to be
        that software has the potential to cause harm, and therefore exposes its
        author to more liability than, say, the author of a book. Apparently,
        disavowing ownership does not get you off the hook in the event that
        your software does cause harm, although I don't know whether this has
        been tested in court or not.</p>

        <p>If you <em>retain</em> your copyright, however, and distribute your
        software under a license, then that gives you the opportunity to
        &ldquo;disclaim any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a
        particular purpose,&rdquo; etc. This appears to be the crucial
        distinction between public domain software and software that is licensed
        under a so-called &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; license such as the <a
        href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD</a> or <a
        href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT</a>

        licenses, which otherwise share the characteristic that anyone can do
        whatever they want with the software. And for this reason, <a
        href="responses.html">both Mr. Rosen and Mr. Lessig recommend that if
        this is your goal&mdash;to let anyone do whatever they want with your
        software&mdash;you should use a liberal license instead of
        dedicating it to the public domain</a>.</p>


        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>The conclusion I draw on both of these questions is that the
        copyright and licensing options for your project will derive from your
        risk tolerance with regard to the law (in balance with other factors,
        such as the intended audience for your software). If you are confident
        in the possibility of explicit dedications to the public domain, and are
        willing to accept any possible liability that might exist by not
        explicitly disclaiming liability via a license, then the public domain
        will be an option for you. If you prefer to chart a safer course, then
        you should consider a liberal license instead of a dedication to the
        public domain.</p>

        <p>If you do want to dedicate your software to the public domain, you
        can use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">the
        process at the Creative Commons</a> to do so. For the record, <a
        href="http://creativecommons.org/faq#faq_entry_3646">the Creative
        Commons licenses are intended for non-software works, and they clearly
        say so in their FAQ</a>. However, the public domain is not a license, it
        is not peculiar to the Creative Commons, and the Creative Commons
        mechanism is the clearest way I've found for performing a dedication.</p>

        <p>In the end, the decision is yours to make&mdash;in consultation
        with your attorney, of course.</p>
